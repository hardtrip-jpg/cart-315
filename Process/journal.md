# Make a Thing - Jan 21, 2026

It's been some time since I last finished a project in Godot. Coming into this, I knew I wanted to re-familiarize myself with my tools, the process, or whatever you call it. I took the opportunity to re-read the docs, and let my mind loose onto the novel ideas it could harbor.

The first idea I had was an old one. One I remember distinctly coming up with and pitching to my partner while on cal approximately 2 years ago. It involved polishing a dirty ball. Once cleaned, the game would celebrate with confetti and reward the player with a short ceremonious tune. However, the game would not close. Players could then continue polishing the ball, as more and more of the ball would be removed. The point being players would eventually polish the flesh off the ball, until the ball would simply vanish. When I first came up with idea, I had no idea how I would pull it off. I have no ability in sharer programming, and at the time little ability in using Godot. So I kept the idea locked in the far reaching depths of my empty mind. With this project, and my technical growth, it finally felt time to bring this idea out of the woodwork and flesh it out. However, before putting any work, I decided to let my other ideas breath.

The second idea involved a mech suit. I'm a big fan of games that offer diagetic interactions with mechanical systems, and I've been wanting to make a game akin to Steel Battalion. Considering the short time frame at hand, I had to scope the idea down a bit. I wondered, "what if the entire game was just turning this thing on?", what if I made a game that only required the first step? Maybe the game could have a manual, one that only existed in game? Maybe the mech is ridiculously difficult to turn on and even has times sequences that must inputted perfectly. I don't know. The idea sounds fun on paper, and not to difficult to setup.

Last but not least, my fire idea. I mean fire alarm idea. This one came to me very last minute, which is funny considering it's the one I stuck with. Essentially, the idea was that I would place players in a house and give them the goal to find and turn off the fire alarm. The whole game would be a prank however, the joke being there is no actual fire alarm. The more I thought about it, the more I could see myself turning this into a horror game, with more and more fire alarms joining in and creating a cacophony of hell. Thinking about exploring this house, I started feeling nostalgic about the 8800 Blue Lick Road listing. This voiceless infinite dripping in mystery and tar. I just really liked the idea of playing a game through the confines of a house listing. As you might have noticed I really enjoy thinking about how players interact with games, and much of my ideas come from exploring the relationship we have with this second reality.

With my nostalgia at hand, and having essentially dreamed up the code that would be required, I set haste for the development of this new and imposing project. I started working on the character controller. Again taking inspiration from generic house listings, I refactored some old code and made a very basic controller in a very small amount of time. Much of my time was spent debugging, or at least realizing that one of my UI nodes was eating up my mouse inputs, making it so my 3D collisions could not detect the mouse entering and exiting their shapes. Once all of that was sorted out, I finally had the beginnings of a game. 

The most 'obvious' part of this game is it's unique visual style. This is about when I came up with it. The idea came from browsing itch.io and looking at some random Decker projects. I've tried using Decker in the past, and am a big fan of it as an idea, but I've always found it very obtuse to use. The visual style Decker proposes is unmatched however, and so I attempted to emulate it with this project. What would it look like to browse an old house listing designed for technology that wasn't ready? I grabbed an old shader shared on the Godot Shaders website, one I had used in the past and I modified it to make it work for this project. I instantly fell in love with look and simply expanded it based on the artificial context I had provided.

By the time I had most components, I realized I had to make a house to explore. I sadly did not have the time to model my own, so I grabbed a very iconic house model used in a plethora of horror slop found online. I got a free fire alarm sound from freesound, added that in and the boom, I had a game. At least, I thought I did. As I added places to explore in the house, the empty stillness began getting to me. I immediately called back to museums, and how they would setup a scene for you to explore, and then add sound effects to help bring you intro their stories. This game was missing that, a sense of place, a story to tell. So I started grabbing a bunch more sounds from freesound and placing them around the house. Adding stories, ideas, life to this house. The house may be empty, but it also didn't have to be. It was around here where I thought it'd be funny to add a scary easter egg, so I grabbed a free spooky model and snuck it in with a scary sound. I then added more scary sounds, help add tension to the game.

With the project done, I must say I am fairly proud of myself. I spent a total of 8 hours on this, and ended up coming up with a fairly weird and unique experience I don't think I would have ever come up with weren't for this class.

# Rob Ford - Jan 29, 2026

Rob Ford is a fascinating figure. A genuinely crazy, nearly mythical figure who has reshaped the city of Toronto for better and for worse. Much worse. Why oh why does this journal begin with a mention of Rob Ford you may ask?
## Ideation
Last week, I watched a video by [Youtuber Bobby Broccoli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nACJOKV_YYA&pp=ygUOYm9iYnkgYnJvY2NvbGnYBuEg) while working on the [[#Make a Thing - Jan 21, 2026]]. The video discusses the Ford family, focusing primarily on the illustrious figure of Rob and his general happenings while he was still with us. Watching this video, I was completely taken aback by the shear pragmatism and pro-activeness Rob illustrated. How can someone make their phone number public, and then make all attempts to consistently answer it whilst help the people on the other side of the line? The man was genuinely crazy, in quite the charismatic way. Since this video, I've been constantly thinking about the man. His crack addiction, his blatant lies and constant destructuring of the government, his volume-us stance. Why don't we have a game about Rob Ford?

Another video that's been surfing the ridges of my brain is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJMBIr90L80) about the game [Gangland](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/gangland-cub). The game itself doesn't follow a specific decipherable structure, and is fairly impossible to describe with playing it. Gangland is clearly inspired by the RTSs of its time, attempting to combine the experience of controlling a mini army, with the expensive business sims found in other tycoon games from that same time. Combined with some RPG progression systems sprinkled in, Gangland remains one of the most mind altering gaming experiences out there, redefining what a game can be.

The main idea that's been orbiting my [field of vision ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGt-0qi8p4Q&list=RDdGt-0qi8p4Q&start_radio=1&pp=ygUcZmllbGQgb2YgdmlzaW9uIGtpbmcgZ2l6emFyZKAHAQ%3D%3D) this week is a combination of Rob Ford and Gangland. A competitive mayoral race, where players actively manage parts of their town while attempting to sabotage others. Players can either complete tasks individually and save on funds, or attempt to balance a budget to open up their personal time. The game would be controlled similar to Gangland, with units that could be sent out to different locations in town as players attempt to make sense of a plethora of menus. 

This game so far only exists as an idea, not even a paper prototype. Its easy to get ideas in game dev, especially when you're someone wholly derivative. The problem is in actualizing said ideas. I've never made anything related to multiplayer throughout my entire game dev journey, though there have been attempts. Every single time, I am completely fall apart as individual, frightened by the drowning documentation hiding underneath the soles of my show. I stutter and I grimace, until I am just ash. For this idea though, it feels a lot more doable. As a whole, I've found that systemic game design is far easier then 3C or any other. I've made plenty of board games, and balancing said board games has always come somewhat naturally to me. For this idea, that's likely where I will start. A simple and effective paper prototype, see if the idea has legs, as mentioned by you last class.
## Work
I wish I got the chance to work more on the physicality of this idea this weak, however work got in the way. When I say work, I mean the main game I'm working on for the Behavior Design chair thing. This week I added a reactive UI, and updated the computer interface system to actually make it seem like a computer system. I also began implementing some assets provided by our resident artist on the project.

This game alone is the most ambitious project I've ever been on. There are multiple systems of interaction, different mini-games, a dialogue system, a complex progression system, just...eugh.... And I am the sole programmer/game dev on this project. It's better this way, since it means the codebase can be as messy as I need it to be. But what it means is that I essentially do all the work. I'm fine with that, and have been learning suprisingly a ton, its genuine life experience for the better. Its just all so very tiring.

## Class
This week, I didn't work on anything but getting myself ready for this next class. I have setup C# properly for Godot, connected Rider and all, and even gotta some basics down for the game we're likely to make this next class. 

I've been questioning myself about what I want to learn throughout this course. I think I need to push my ideas a bit more, give myself space for them. This week I had a breakdown during work of just pure mental exhaustion in lack of self expression, and I felt the desire to make something random so desperately come to me. I think for me this is what this class should be, just experimentation. See what can I actually make. Tiny day long game jams, push myself and my portfolio.
